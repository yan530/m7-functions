# Exercise 2: writing and executing functions (II)

# Write a function `CompareLength` that takes in 2 vectors, and returns the sentence:
# "The difference in lengths is N"
compareLength <- function(a, b){
  answer <- a - b
  return ("The difference in lengths is " + answer)
}
  

# Pass two vectors of different length to your `CompareLength` function
compareLength(1, 2)

# Write a function `DescribeDifference` that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first vector is longer by N elements"
# "Your second vector is longer by N elements"
DescribeDifference <- function(a, b){
  if (a > b){
    return ("Your first vector is longer by " + (a - b) + "N elements")
  } else {
    return ("Your first vector is longer by " + (b - a) + "N elements")
  }
}
  

# Pass two vectors to your `DescribeDifference` function


### Bonus ###

# Rewrite your `DescribeDifference` function to tell you the name of the vector which is longer
